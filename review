Below is an executive-level review of the repository's recent Git history plus a synthesis of the IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md and README.md to frame what still has to be done to reach an MVP that can run on Render and execute real swaps for users.
────────────────────────────────────
Recent Git Activity (high-signal)
HEAD → ea94dc0 "chore: clean up browser errors" (11 May)
• Deleted stray files: .python-version, several "=x.y.z" patch logs.
• UI polish / DOM cleanup:
– Removed the temporary "Pectra" badge injection logic in moduleLoader.js.
– Changed <label> elements that were purely cosmetic to <p> for a11y.
– Fixed mismatched IDs in toggle switch markup (enable-swap-toggle).
• JS refactors:
– TokenAddresses is now an exported constant (smartAccount.js).
– walletCore.js initialises an empty placeholder (window.walletCore = {}) first, then wires real methods—eliminates console noise.
– Misc warning-string tweaks and comments.
fbf641ff "chore: refactor code and split files" (10 May)
• Large structural move—split monolithic Wallet/Swap helpers into granular "Manager.js" modules.
• Front-end build artifacts removed from repo; now ignored.
• Updated Tailwind build, ESLint config and package versions.
a6d3b90 "chore: contract first draft" (10 May)
• Added contracts/SmartAccount.sol, contracts/SimpleSwap.sol.
• Scaffolded Hardhat scripts (deploy.js, deploy:local, extract-addresses.js).
• Initial tests for swap flows (found in test/).
Net takeaway: the codebase is cleaner, browser console warnings are gone, and token/config exports are now import-friendly for other modules.

Key points from IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md & README.md
• Environment problems called out:
1 Flask/Werkzeug pinning → use 2.0.1.
2 OpenZeppelin contracts not installed.
3 Swap failing locally because there is no USDC token deployed.
• Two viable local solutions for USDC:
A Deploy a MockUSDC contract.
B Point SimpleSwap at Hardhat Account #1 as a "fake" USDC address.
• Deployment workflow spelled out for Hardhat → Linea Testnet → Linea Mainnet with scripts + .env.
• For Render hosting:
– Procfile or render.yaml not yet present.
– Secrets (.env) must be injected via Render dashboard.
• README emphasises Python 3.10 + Poetry, Node 18, Tailwind build, and front-end LLM features.
It still flags "NOT intended for real trading" even though the new goal is real swaps.

Gap Analysis & Next-Step Checklist to Reach MVP on Render
Backend / Smart-Contracts
① Finish MockUSDC or real USDC address workflow.
• If you stay with mocks in local, ensure SimpleSwap.setUsdcAddress() exists and is called post-deploy for testnet/mainnet.
② Expand SimpleSwap to support slippage controls and re-entrancy guard (OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard).
③ Add Hardhat verification script to auto-verify on Lineascan after deploy.
Front-End / JS
④ Wire the new exported TokenAddresses into every module that referenced the previous in-file constant.
⑤ Re-enable a subtle UX indicator (badge or tooltip) for EIP-7702 features—now optional after cleanup commit.
⑥ Guard against "External transactions cannot include data" by disabling swap button if USDC address isn't set.
Python / Flask
⑦ Pin Flask/Werkzeug 2.0.1 in pyproject.toml and rebuild lockfile.
⑧ Create a /api/swaps/price endpoint to pull on-chain quote for the exact user amount (currently simulated).
CI/CD & Render
⑨ Add:
• render.yaml (build: npm run build && poetry install, start: poetry run python -m src.web.app).
• Procfile for fallback: web: python -m src.web.app.
⑩ Add a GitHub Action to run npm test, npm run lint, pytest, and hardhat test.
⑪ Document required Render environment variables (PRIVATE_KEY, LINEA_RPC_URL, etc.) in README.
Security / Production Hardening
⑫ Move any plaintext test private keys into .env.example only; scrub from code.
⑬ Rate-limit swap endpoint and add basic abuse monitoring (Render offers "DDoS protection" tiers).
⑭ Add CSP headers in Flask (flask-talisman) to lock down front-end.
Testing
⑮ Expand Hardhat tests to include:
• Gas-token payments (ERC-20 fee).
• Batch transactions success path.
⑯ End-to-end Cypress or Playwright test that spins up local Hardhat node + front-end and completes a swap.
Docs
⑰ Update README "Important Disclaimer" to state mainnet trading is live; include risk notice and encourage small trades.
⑱ Add quick-start for Render deploy: "One-click Deploy" button using Render blueprints.
────────────────────────────────────
Recommended Immediate Actions (this sprint)
Add OpenZeppelin dependency and implement/deploy MockUSDC → close issue #2 & #3.
Pin Flask/Werkzeug in Poetry → close issue #1.
Create render.yaml & Procfile, push to repo; set up Render test service.
Run full local e2e test (Hardhat + browser) to confirm swaps succeed with gas paid in ETH and in USDC.
If green, deploy to Linea Testnet from CI and verify contracts.
Completing those will put us one deploy away from an MVP that can execute real swaps for users' wallets on Render.
Let me know which section you'd like to tackle first, or if you want detailed code edits / Render config files drafted now.
